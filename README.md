# Music-Player

## Description:
This is a Music Player that takes in MP3 files from a local folder and displays controls for listening to the files. These songs are displayed on a visually pleasing GUI with back, play/pause, next, and volume controls. This project was a ton of fun to create, and I plan on adding more features to this project in the future.

## Features
- Java, FXML, CSS
- CSS Stylesheet implementation
- Control Buttons: Back, Play/Pause, Next, Volume Control
- Songs are loaded via a local folder
- Custom Layout with min, max, close buttons and also resizeable from bottom right. 

## To Do:
- Get "Add Mp3 Button" working, and able to add new songs
- Add way to easily configure color scheme and accent colors without changing CSS stylesheet
- Add sorting songlist by Song name, Artist, Length
- Optimize, Optimize, Optimize

## Fun Little Tidbits:
During the design and implementation of this project I challenged myself not to use image files when creating the GUI, therefore the buttons were made via handmade SVG paths, and the default album cover was made using CSS styling. Also to better understand FXML, I opted to not use SceneBuilder. However, if I was to redo this Music Player I would likely use a SceneBuilder to simply the process.
