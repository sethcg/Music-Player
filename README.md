# Music-Player

## Description:
This is a Music Player that takes in MP3 files from a local folder and displays controls for listening to the files. The song files are displayed on a visually pleasing GUI with many bells and whistles, including a simple method of adding files, deleting files, and buttons to meet all the users needs. This project was a ton of fun to create, for now the project is complete but I may look into some optimizations in the future.

## Features
- Java, FXML, CSS
- CSS Stylesheet implementation
- Control Buttons: Back, Play/Pause, Next, Shuffle, Repeat, Volume Control
- Dynamic Accent Color Settings (Saved as a Preference)
- Easy method of adding and deleting files
- Custom Layout with handmade SVG paths

## To Do:
- ~~Add easy ability to add/delete songs~~
- ~~Add way to easily configure color scheme and accent colors without changing CSS stylesheet~~
- ~~Add way to sort the songs~~

----

## Fun Little Tidbits:
During the design and implementation of this project I challenged myself not to use image files when creating the GUI, therefore the buttons were made via handmade SVG paths, and the default album cover was made using CSS styling. Also to better understand FXML, I opted to not use SceneBuilder. However, if I was to redo this Music Player I would likely use SceneBuilder to simply the process.
