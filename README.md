# Music-Player

## Description:
This is a Music Player that takes in MP3 files from a local folder and displays controls for listening to the files. These songs are displayed on a visually pleasing GUI with back, play/pause, next, and volume controls. This project was a ton of fun to create, and I plan on adding more features to this project in the future.

## Fun Little Tidbits:
During the design and implementation of this project I challenged myself not to use image files when creating the GUI, therefore the buttons were made via handmade SVG paths, and the default album cover was made using CSS styling. Also to better understand FXML, I opted to not use SceneBuilder. However, if I was to redo this Music Player I would likely use a SceneBuilder to simply the process.
